The goal today is to get a basic GraphQL server up and running. It should have a base schema for a local mongodb and also collect data from the breweryDB API. It should return that data in a single request.

####Bonus Points

~Implement an accounts system using Passport and create a local user collection. Then connect the user and beer data.~

More important than an accounts systme at this point is to get the app deployed.
