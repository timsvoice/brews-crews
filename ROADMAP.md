Yesterday we got the server up and running and deployed to a Heroku instance. Following our weekly goals, we are ahead by half a day. Today we should investigate the Apollo Client library and begin a basic implementation. The goal will be to have a page that displays results from a reviews request to the API. This should be deployed to the Heroku instance.

####Bonus Points

The goal today is to get a basic GraphQL server up and running. It should have a base schema for a local mongodb and also collect data from the breweryDB API. It should return that data in a single request.

####Bonus Points

~Implement an accounts system using Passport and create a local user collection. Then connect the user and beer data.~

More important than an accounts systme at this point is to get the app deployed.
